Overview
In this project, you will build a Mini Inventory System using Python. The system must use two
classes (Product and Inventory) and basic file I/O. Only concepts from Modules 1–4 are
allowed: variables, loops, conditionals, lists, functions, classes, and basic file input/output.

Scenario
A small shop currently tracks its inventory by hand. They want a simple computer program that
can load products from a file, allow the user to add, sell, and restock products, display all
products, and save the updated data back to the file when the program exits.
