This is a "Mini Inventory System" programmed using Python.
The system uses two classes (Product and Inventory) and basic file I/O. 
Concepts from CPRG216 are used (variables, loops, conditionals, lists, functions, classes, and basic file input/output.)

What the project does: allows the user to load products from a file, allow the user to add, sell, and restock products, display all
products, and save the updated data back to the file when the program exits.
Why the project is useful: scenario for the project is that a small shop currently tracks its inventory by hand. They want a simple computer program that can make the process easier
How users can get started with the project: run the main.py program and the program will prompt you what to input.
