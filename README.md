This is a "Mini Inventory System" programmed using Python:

Final project in Object-Oriented 1 CPRG216 dual credit course at SAIT. (I got 100 btw!)


The system uses two classes (Product and Inventory)
As well as other concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, lists, functions, classes, and basic file I/O.


🌠 What the project does: allows the user to load products from a file, allow the user to add, sell, and restock products, display all
products, and save the updated data back to the file when the program exits.

🌷 Why the project is useful: scenario for the project is that a small shop currently tracks its inventory by hand. They want a simple computer program that can make the process easier.

🐇 How users can get started with the project: download the repository and run the main.py file. The program will prompt you what to input from there.
